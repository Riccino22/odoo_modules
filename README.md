A series of Odoo projects that extend the functionalities of the native Odoo modules:
### [Helpdesk_extended](https://github.com/Riccino22/odoo_projects/tree/main/helpdesk_extended)
This is an Odoo module that adds two functions to Odoo's helpdesk module: allowing users to submit ticket category suggestions, and sending an error message to the user if the ticket description is less than 15 characters.
